        <div class="contentText"><a href="https://github.com/phase4ground/documents/blob/master/Papers_Articles_Presentations/Papers/Phase4Space.pdf">Kickoff document here</a>.<br> Phase 4 Space is an open source project primarily intended for <a href="http://www.amsat.org">AMSAT</a>. Our goal is to provide both designs and equipment for a spacecraft that will use a 5GHz uplink and a 10GHz downlink. Our mission is to provide an open source implementation of <a href = "https://www.dvb.org/standards/dvb-s2">DVB-S2</a> and <a href = "https://www.dvb.org/standards/dvb-s2x">DVB-S2X</a> for amateur satellite service use. The reference design will be in <a href="https://www.gnuradio.org/">GNU Radio</a>. </div>
        
        
        
        
  <div class="contentTitle"><h1>The Hard Part </h1></div>
        <div class="contentText">Developing a satellite is a big challenge. The most difficult management part is dealing with ITAR. The technical challenges are daunting as well and include everything from FPGA designs to power supplies. This is a substantial effort that will take a wide variety of people and skillsets to accomplish.

  <div class="contentTitle"><h1>The Easy Part </h1></div>
        <div class="contentText">It's a golden age! Digital communications engineering has never been as fun and full of possibilities as it is right now. There are so many powerful parts, support, research, and tools available. Take your pick ranging from a multitude of SDRs to inexpensive development boards to integrated developement environments. Books, videos, free and low-cost classes, supportive communities, and amazing clubs and organizations are literally at your fingertips. Being part of the embedded processing world right now, and especially being part of the explosions of digital communications, is an adventure well worth your time. Yes, it's hard work, but it's completely worth it!
